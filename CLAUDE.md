# KluePortal Development Session

## Project Overview
KluePortal is a sophisticated Laravel application implementing enterprise-level flow and task management with advanced role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-tenant architecture.

## Architecture Decisions Made

### 1. Task DTO Implementation
- **Created TaskDto** with support for multiple assignees and approvers
- **Implemented AssigneeRole enum** for domain-specific responsibilities (ASSIGNEE, APPROVER, REVIEWER, OBSERVER)
- **Separated concerns**: RoleEnum (authorization) vs AssigneeRole (task responsibility)

### 2. General AssigneeDto for Polymorphic Use
- **Created AssigneeDto** under `app/DTOs/AssignableEntity/` for any assignable entity
- **Focused on domain logic** rather than replicating User model fields
- **Integrated with RoleEnum** for authorization levels and permissions
- **Added workflow support** with notification targeting and status transitions

### 3. Performance Testing Infrastructure
- **Enhanced DatabaseSeeder** for large-scale performance testing:
  - 1,000 users across multiple tenants
  - 300 tenants with realistic distribution
  - 1,500 flows (5 per tenant guaranteed)
  - Maximum 10 participants per flow/tenant
  - test@example.com user as admin on 5 tenants (realistic limit)

### 4. Performance Results Achieved
- **Without cache**: 602ms, 6MB memory
- **With cache**: 226ms, 5MB memory
- **62% performance improvement** with caching
- **Modal loading**: 150ms for flow member management
- **Enterprise-scale performance** with sub-second response times

### 5. Database Architecture Planning
- **Evaluated database separation** strategies
- **Decided on dual-database approach**:
  - **Main DB**: Core entities (users, tenants, flows, tasks, roles, model_has_roles)
  - **Business DB**: Supplementary data (attachments, annotations, comments, time logs)
- **Maintains referential integrity** for authorization system
- **Enables parallel loading** using Laravel's `defer()` function

### 6. Indexing Strategy
- While indexing a database, don't create separate indexes for the relations, laravel does it already

## Technical Implementation Details

### DTOs Created
```
app/DTOs/
├── Task/
│   ├── TaskDto.php
│   ├── TaskAssigneeDto.php
│   └── TaskApproverDto.php
└── AssignableEntity/
    └── AssigneeDto.php
```

### Enums Implemented
```
app/Enums/
└── AssigneeRole.php (ASSIGNEE, APPROVER, REVIEWER, OBSERVER)
```

### Key Features
- **Polymorphic RBAC system** with caching
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with proper isolation
- **Workflow notifications** based on AssigneeRole responsibilities
- **Performance optimization** through intelligent caching strategies
- **Type-safe DTOs** with validation and casting

### Caching Strategy
- **Role-based caching** with 1-hour TTL
- **Selective cache invalidation** on role changes
- **Participant caching** by entity type
- **Memory-efficient** cache usage (actually reduces memory while improving performance)

### Performance Optimizations
- **Chunked operations** for large datasets
- **Bulk role creation** with `createMany()`
- **Efficient random sampling** for realistic test data
- **Bounded collections** with participant limits

## Database Seeder Configuration

### Current Scale
- **Users**: 1,000 (created in batches of 100)
- **Tenants**: 300 (test user admin on first 5)
- **Flows**: 1,500 (exactly 5 per tenant)
- **Participants**: Max 10 per flow, max 10 per tenant
- **Realistic distribution**: 60% users have 1 tenant, 25% have 2, etc.

### Test User Access
- **Email**: test@example.com
- **Password**: password
- **Role**: ADMIN on 5 tenants
- **Access**: Can manage flows across assigned tenants

## Architecture Quality Assessment

### Code Quality: Above Average
- **Proper separation of concerns** with services and DTOs
- **Good use of Laravel's polymorphic relationships**
- **Reasonable caching implementation**
- **Clean directory structure** and consistent naming

### Performance Profile
- **226ms response time** at enterprise scale
- **5MB memory usage** - efficient for complexity
- **Sub-200ms modal loading** for member management
- **Scales linearly** with predictable performance

### Best Practices Implemented
- **Contract-based programming** with interfaces
- **Trait-based composition** for cross-cutting concerns
- **Value objects and DTOs** for type safety
- **Event-driven architecture** for role assignments
- **Professional testing** with realistic scenarios

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
- **Tasks with time-based annotations** (no streaming, just timestamps + comments)
- **File attachments** via DO Spaces (metadata only in database)
- **Comment threads** for collaboration

### Infrastructure Scaling
- **2GB droplet capacity**: 40+ concurrent processes at current memory usage
- **1GB MySQL server**: Sufficient for 10x growth
- **DO Spaces**: Handles file storage and bandwidth scaling

### Database Separation Strategy
- **Parallel loading** using Laravel's `defer()` and Livewire lazy components
- **Load distribution** between main and business databases
- **Progressive enhancement** for user experience

## Commands and Operations

### Running Performance Tests
```bash
php artisan db:seed --class=DatabaseSeeder
```

### Cache Management
- **Automatic cache invalidation** on role changes
- **1-hour TTL** for optimal performance balance
- **Configurable caching** via `config('role.should_cache')`

## Development Guidelines

- **When using svg icons always use hero icons**
- **Always apply dark and light mode for css, dark mode using .dark**
- **Always use alpine's event syntax @ and .stop or .prevent instead of native js registering events, also .window for global events**
- **Use zinc instead of gray and sky instead of blue**
- **Always use alpines x-tooltip plugin for tooltips**
- **Always use ulids for bd. and for morphs always use getMorphClass()**
- **Stick to Relation::getMorphAlias, and Relation::getMorphedModel()**
- **Always use x-anchor for any drop down**
